# EX.NO 5 Sub Queries and Views in SQL
### DATE: 20.03.2020
#### REGISTER NUMBER: 212222040050
## AIM:
To study and implement Subqueries and Views in SQL 
## THEORY
## SUB QUERIES 
* The query within another is known as a subquery. A statement containing a subquery is called a parent statement.
* A subquery may occur in :
- A SELECT clause
- A FROM clause
- A WHERE clause
*The subquery can be nested inside a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement or inside another subquery.
## Types of SubQueries
1. Sub queries that return several values - Sub queries can also return more than one value. Such results should be made use along with the operators in and any.
2. Multiple queries- Here more than one subquery is used. These multiple sub queries are combined by means of ‘and’ & ‘or’ keywords. 
3. Correlated subquery- A subquery is evaluated once for the entire parent statement whereas a correlated Sub query is evaluated once per row processed by the parent statement.
## Views
```
In SQL, a view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement. A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database. 
Syntax: 
CREATE VIEW 
AS 
SELECT FROM relation_name WHERE (Condition);
To drop a view by
Syntax: DROP VIEW viewname;
```
## PROCEDURE
```
1. Start the program. 
2. Read the given query.
3. Write the sub query for a given query.
4. Create a view using
	CREATE VIEW 
	AS 
	SELECT FROM relation_name WHERE (Condition);
5. Show the output
6. Stop the program
